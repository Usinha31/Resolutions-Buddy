People make resolutions on 1st Jan every year but eventually they fail to complete the resolutions. So maybe we can make some kind of a system where people can submit their new year resolutions with their email ids, and then they'll get email reminders about their resolutions periodically, so that they will more likely end up actually completing their resolutions! And once they complete it, they can again log in to the site and just input that 'goals achieved' or something like that, so that they'll stop getting reminders.
